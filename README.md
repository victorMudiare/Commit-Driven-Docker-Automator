## Introduction

This Python script automates the building of a Docker image when a new Git commit is detected since the last build. It helps streamline the process of keeping your Docker images up-to-date with your codebase.

## How it Works

The script checks for new commits in your Git repository. If a new commit is detected since the last build, it triggers the building of a Docker image using the latest commit hash as the image tag. The last commit hash is stored in a JSON file to keep track of the previous build.

## Getting Started

1. *Clone this repository:*

    bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    

2. *Install the required Python packages using `requirements.txt`:*

    bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    

3. *Modify the script:*

    - Set your Docker image name in the script.
    - Adjust the `commit_data_file` variable to the appropriate path for your JSON file.

4. *Run the script:*

    bash
    python build_docker_on_commit.py
    

## Configuration

In the `build_docker_on_commit.py` script, you'll find the following configurable variables:

- `your-image-name`: Set your desired Docker image name.
- `commit_data_file`: Adjust this to specify the path for the JSON file storing the last commit hash.

## Requirements

- Python (>=3.6)
-Â Docker
